# Writing-Tests-With-Truffle

### In this project there 6 different contracts written along with a number of unit tests written for each of the contracts. This is a good practice for anyone looking to learn how to write unit tests or simply brushen up on them. If cloning the project, use 'truffle compile' and 'truffle test' to run the tests.
